A sandbox-style repository used to experiment with **Three.js**, explore various rendering techniques, test features, and learn 3D concepts step-by-step.  
This project is intentionally simple and iterative, serving as a personal learning space.

## Features

- Basic Three.js scenes (meshes, materials, lights, animations)
- Experiments with cameras, controls, and geometry
- Vite development environment for fast builds and hot reload
- Incremental tests and prototypes as learning progresses

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```
